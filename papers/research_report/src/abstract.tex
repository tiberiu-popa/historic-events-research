The present paper aims to establish the correlation between significant historic events and the texts written in that period. In order for the analysis to be useful, it must be based on a representative set of texts written throughout history. To this end, instead of relying on manually selected texts, the Google Books Ngram Corpus has been chosen as a basis for the analysis. Although providing only n-gram statistics for all the texts written in a given year, the resulting time series are a source of insight into the correlation between historic events and texts.
