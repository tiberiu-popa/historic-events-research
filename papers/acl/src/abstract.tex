Many historic events are remembered by slogans, expressions or words that are strongly linked to them. Educated people are also able to determine whether a particular word or expression is related to a particular period in history. The present paper aims to establish the correlation between significant historic events and the texts written in that period, thus allowing a system to automatically links words to periods of time. In order for the analysis to be useful, it must be based on a representative set of texts written throughout history. To this end, instead of relying on manually selected texts, the Google Books Ngram Corpus has been chosen as a basis for the analysis. Although it provides only word n-gram statistics for all the texts written in a given year, the resulting time series are a source of insight into the correlation between historic events and texts.
