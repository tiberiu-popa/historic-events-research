Traditionally, historic events have been analyzed from the perspective of carefully selected texts, deemed historically significant. This has allowed historians to paint accurate descriptions of important events in our history, focusing on motives, narrative and the influence on human culture.

However, as proven by the recent advent of the field of culturomics, introduced in \newcite{Michel14012011}, there is much to be learned by analyzing the large collections of books available in electronic form. This paper delves deeper into the implications of this approach to the analysis of historic events. Thus, the purpose is to devise a model that can be used for the identification of important events in texts, by using quantitative data collected from millions of books instead of relying on understanding a few select texts.
