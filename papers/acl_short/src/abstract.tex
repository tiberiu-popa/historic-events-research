Important historic events are remembered by people through words or expressions that are strongly linked to them. The present paper aims to establish the correlation between significant historic events and the texts written in that period, thus allowing a system to automatically link words to periods of time. For our analysis, we have used the Google Books Ngram Corpus as a representative set of texts written throughout history. Although it provides only word n-gram statistics for all the texts written in a given year, the resulting time series are a source of insight into the correlation between historic events and texts.
