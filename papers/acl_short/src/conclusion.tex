In this paper has been described a novel thoretical framework for identifying historic events in texts, its key component being the notion of historical relevance of a word. This abstraction can be used to explore and compare various possibilities of identifying historic events.

Furthermore, several possible definitions for the above notions have been proposed. A study of the results has shown that while most of the important historic events are represented in the discovered topics in at least one of the models, there is not a single one that can claim supremacy.

One of the most important directions for future work is exploring alternatives for various steps in the workflow. For example, one can wonder if topic models are really the key of understanding the historically relevant documents, or if a better model can be used. The final future research direction is focused on automatically finding a means for comparing the results produced by different algorithms.
