Topic models specify a mixture of topics for each historically relevant document and thus for each year. The analysis of all variants of relevance has shown that only rarely does a year fail to have a dominant topic (over $50 \%$), so only the most likely topic for each year shall be considered.

Though seemingly the weakest model, the double change algorithm has generated some of the most accurate topics for certain periods of time. For example, the topic for the years $1858$ to $1864$ and $1867$ to $1868$,  directly to the American Civil War (see Figure~\ref{fig:civil-war-related-series}), is composed of the following main words: rebel, confederate, wolff, mcclellan, schleswig, secession, vicksburg, rebels, chattanooga, sherman, wedgwood, holstein, longstreet and flax.

\end{figure}

For the linear model peak detection, the time period under consideration spans from $1932$ to $1936$, filled with events that foreshadowed World War II. The detected topic consists of fascist, depression, rubber, communism, pact, vitamin, broadcasting, reconstruction, recovery, radio, employers, socialism, communists and manchuria. The selected words, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pre-ww2-related-series}, paint an accurate image of that period.

\label{fig:ww1-related-series}
%\end{figure*}
\end{figure}

For the Gaussian model peak detection, the interval $1916 - 1920$ has a topic consisting of: artillery, target, syndrome, nationalism, naval, democracy, alcohol, battalion, pan, rehabilitation, defense, von, aircraft, navy, strategic, austria, damping, mobilize and firing. The words pertaining to World War I are shown together in Figure~\ref{fig:ww1-related-series}.

However, many of the words present in these topics convey little information about a historic event, creating lots of noise. Currently, their removal is done manually, but automating this task will most likely become the target of future research. An example of historic topics, describing the last century, can be seen in Table~\ref{tbl:topic-evolution} (obtained using the Gaussian model with $\omega = 2$).
